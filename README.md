# Brain-Corp-Coding-Challenge

This is my submission for 2022 Software Engineering-BrainOS Internship/Co-Op Coding Challenge. 

I have tested my code against some test cases and it works fine. However, due the time limit, I was still trying to configure with a more organized unit test file. I intend to add more test cases and measure the runtime of my algorithm.
